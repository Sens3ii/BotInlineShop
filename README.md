#  BotInlineShop
## Description:
I decided to master the development of bots in telegrams. So this repository was created for a store with inline menu control. The bot uses the aiogram async library. Also the bot admin panel is written on Django.
Shop is available in telegram under the tag: @shop_329_bot
